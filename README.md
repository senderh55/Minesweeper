# Minesweeper
As part of my Java course at college, I implemented the Minesweeper game


* Mines.java includes creation of game board (matrix allocation), mines, toggle flags and the game logic (winning chacking, etc.)

* Minesweeper.fxml is the visual aspect of the game (GUI).

* MyController.java is the controller that connects the visual and logical parts.

* Main.java creating the visual part (created by scene builder) and initializing the controller.
